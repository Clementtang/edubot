The agencies that work with countries worldwide whose economy is very fragile and the levels of poverty are high, recognize that having an educated population allows creating better job opportunities.</p><p>By having better access to jobs that allow for a better standard of living, the essential foundations are established so that families have access to better resources. In addition, together with the government, better education plans are developed so that children from early ages attend school. However, the problem of education is much greater and complex than it seems. Many poor families do not have enough money to send their children to school.</p><h2>Problems and Facts</h2><p>Why we are focus on Education?</p><ul><li>Primary education in developing countries has reached 91%, but 6 out of 10 children and adolescents are not achieving a minimum level of proficiency in reading and math.</li><li>We are trying to figure out Quality might be the cause of high primary education rate but still lots of children are not achieving a minimum level of proficiency.</li></ul><p>How we can improve the quality of Education?</p><ul><li>We are looking to start with teachers and professors (such as educators from: elementary, high school and university), by providing more support to educators they will bring more long term impact.</li><li>Studies proved that mentorship helps <a href="https://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/us/2018/07/16/mentors-matter-good-teaching-really-can-be-passed-down-to-student-teachers-new-research-finds/" target="_blank">teacher to perform their skill</a> for share knowledge and experience.</li></ul><h2>Sustainable Development GOALS</h2><img src="/img/sdg.png"/><p>The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are an urgent call for action by all countries – developed and developing – in a global partnership. They recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests.</p><p>Today, the Division for Sustainable Development Goals (DSDG) in the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) provides substantive support and capacity-building for the SDGs and their related thematic issues, including water, energy, climate, oceans, urbanization, transport, science and technology, the Global Sustainable Development Report (GSDR), partnerships and Small Island Developing States. DSDG plays a key role in the evaluation of UN systemwide implementation of the 2030 Agenda and on advocacy and outreach activities relating to the SDGs. In order to make the 2030 Agenda a reality, broad ownership of the SDGs must translate into a strong commitment by all stakeholders to implement the global goals. DSDG aims to help facilitate this engagement.</p></div></div></div></div><footer class="nav-footer" id="footer"><section class="sitemap"><a href="/" class="nav-home"><img src="/img/logo.png" alt="EduBot" width="66" height="58"/></a><div><h5>About Us</h5><a href="https://devpost.com/software/edubot-me-bsu3e0">F8 2019 Hackathon DevPost Project</a></div><div><h5>Community</h5><a href="https://www.faceobok.com/edubot.me">Facebook</a><a href="https://m.me/edubot.me" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Messenger Chatbot</a></div></section><section class="copyright">Copyright © 2019 EduBot</section></footer></div></body></html>
